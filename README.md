# Search-Algorithms
Displays Breadth-first-search and Depth-first-search algorithms on randomly generated mazes as well as gives the user the option to play.
## Contributors: @poojprab
### Made in CS2510 at Northeastern University

## How to play: 
- By following the instructions displayed on the pop-up window, users are given the opportunity to either:
   - Watch the program complete the specified search algorithm (BREADTH FIRST) OR (DEPTH FIRST)
   - Play the maze itself and see how well they fare against the search algorithms.
 
## Skills acquired: 
- Made use of stacks to use the Breadth First Search Algorithm and Queues for the Depth First Search Algorithm
- First real use of Hashmaps
- Used Kruskal's search algorithm
- Used weighted "edges" and "vertexes"
- Used minimum spanning trees in order to use the algorithm
- Used the Union/Find Data Structure
